"""
AI-Powered Git Commit Message Generator

This script analyzes your staged git changes, learns from your repository's
commit history, and uses the Gemini AI model to generate a suggested
commit message.

**Prerequisites:**
1.  You must have the `google-generativeai` library installed:
    pip install google-generativeai

2.  You need to configure your Gemini API key. The script will prompt you
    to enter it if it's not found in the GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable.

**How it works:**
1.  Checks for uncommitted changes.
2.  Stages all modified and new files (`git add .`).
3.  Fetches the last 10 commit messages to learn the project's style.
4.  Gets the `git diff --staged` output, which shows the actual code changes.
5.  Sends the diff and the commit history examples to the Gemini API.
6.  Presents the AI-generated commit message for your approval.
7.  If you approve, it performs the commit.

    You are an expert programmer and git user. Your task is to write a clear, concise, and conventional commit message.

    Analyze the following 'git diff --staged' output and the recent commit history to understand the context and the project's conventions.

    **Recent Commit History (for style reference):**
    ---
    {history}
    ---

    **Staged Changes (git diff):**
    ---
    {diff}
    ---

    **Instructions:**
    1. Write a commit message that accurately summarizes the changes.
    2. Follow the conventional commit format if it seems to be used in the history (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:`).
    3. The first line (subject) should be 50 characters or less.
    4. After the subject, add a blank line, followed by a more detailed body explaining the 'what' and 'why' of the changes if necessary.
    5. Do not include any introductory text like "Here is the commit message:". Just provide the raw commit message.
